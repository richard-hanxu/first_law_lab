The heat loss per second was calculated by taking the difference
in cumulative heat transfer between two points and dividing by the
time difference. The two points were when the internal temperature
first reached the target temperature of the trial, and at least 2 minutes
afterwards. The first point was found by finding the time 
where the average in a 1s interval (looking ahead and backwards by 0.5s)
was within 0.1 deg C of the target temperature.

The temperature and pressure before and after mass was added to the cylinders
was measured, and the mass added was found by calculating the riemann sum 
of the mass flow rate for the time interval.
