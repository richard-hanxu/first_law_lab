The heat loss per second was calculated by taking the difference
in cumulative heat transfer between two points and dividing by the
time difference. The two points were when the internal temperature
first reached the target temperature of the trial, and at least 2 minutes
afterwards. The first point was found by finding the time 
where the average in a 1s interval (looking ahead and backwards by 0.5s)
was within 0.1 deg C of the target temperature.
